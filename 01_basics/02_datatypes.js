/**
 * Data types in JavaScript include:
 * 
 * 1. Primitive Types:
 *    - string: Represents textual data (e.g., "hello").
 *    - number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers (e.g., 42, 3.14). Number also   have a range as (+2 and -2 ^53 -1 )
 *    - boolean: Represents logical entities (true or false).
 *    - undefined: Indicates a variable that has not been assigned a value.
 *    - null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
 *    - symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value (introduced in ES6).
 *    - bigint: Represents integers with arbitrary precision (introduced in ES2020).
 * 
 * 2. Object Types:
 *    - object: Used to store collections of data and more complex entities (e.g., arrays, functions, dates, etc.).

 * ðŸ“š Recommended Documentation Resources
 *
 * 1. MDN Web Docs by Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript  
 *    MDN is the go-to resource for learning and referencing JavaScript. 
 *    Most web developers rely on it for accurate, up-to-date documentation 
 *    that aligns closely with real-world browser behavior.
 *
 * 2. ECMAScript Specification: https://tc39.es/ecma262/  
 *    The official ECMAScript specification defines how JavaScript works at its core.  
 *    While MDN is great for practical development, the ECMAScript docs are essential 
 *    for understanding the language at an engine level. Theyâ€™re especially useful for 
 *    those building compilers, browsers, or JavaScript engines.
